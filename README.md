# Gîtes Mon Trésor web site update

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's new? 

### Maps API

Most part of static websites does not support maps integration and since GoogleApi normally does not work on client's side, we had to find a workaround.   
    
We used **@react-google-maps/api** that provides very simple bindings to the google maps api and lets you use it in your app as React components.
